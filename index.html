<h1>Koheletic Nuance</h1>

<p>You're probably looking for my crappy webnovel.
That's the only thing I have up here (for now!)</p>

<a href="the-walaganth/chapter-1.html"><h2>The Walaganth</h2></a>
<p>A horror-fantascy-sci-fi-rom-com. The protagonist is a college-age girl that kills demons with a weapon designed by her father and powered by his soul.
What more could you want?</p>
