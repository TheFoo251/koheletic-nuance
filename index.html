<h1>Koheletic Nuance</h1>

<p>You're probably looking for my crappy webnovel(s).
There's a short story now too.</p>

<a href="walaganth-the/chapter-1.html"><h2>The Walaganth</h2></a>
<p>
An edgy first-person horror-fantascy-sci-fi-rom-com. Really, it's a Proper Friggen Isekai.
The protagonist is a gunsmith that kills demons with a weapon designed by her father and powered by his soul.
What more could you want?
</p>

<a href="lotf/chapter-1.html"><h2>Lillies of the Field</h2></a>
<p>
A slighly more somber third-person tale that takes place in the good 'ol Appalachain mountains.
The story is about undergraduate researchers that discover magic and become responsible for determining its use.
Is magic worth the trouble, or does it hurt more than it helps?
